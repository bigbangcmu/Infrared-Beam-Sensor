# Infrared-Beam-Sensor
**The Infrared Beam Sensor** is a type of photoelectric sensor that detects the presence or movement of objects using an invisible infrared (IR) beam. It consists of two separate units: a transmitter, which emits a continuous IR beam, and a receiver, which detects the beam. When an object passes through and interrupts the beam, the sensor triggers a response—such as activating an alarm or switching a connected device.

This sensor is known for its fast response time and high reliability, making it ideal for a wide range of indoor and outdoor automation systems.

## This sensor is suitable for:
- Security and alarm systems
- Automatic doors and gates
- Access control and people counting
- Robotics and motion detection
- Industrial automation systems

**Cautions**
- Avoid modifying wires or connecting them incorrectly, as this may damage the device.
- Do not touch the sensor head while it is operating, as it may affect detection accuracy.
- If the sensor does not work, check the voltage and wiring connections.
